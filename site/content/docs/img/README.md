## How to Update these Images

- [pinniped.svg](pinniped.svg) was generated using [`plantuml`](https://plantuml.com/).
  To regenerate the image, run `plantuml -tsvg pinniped.txt` from this directory.

- [pinniped_architecture.svg](pinniped_architecture.svg) was created on [draw.io](https://draw.io).
  It can be opened again for editing on that site by choosing "File" -> "Open from" -> "Device".
  Because it includes embedded icons it should be exported using "File" -> "Export as" -> "SVG",
  with the "Transparent Background", "Embed Images", and "Include a copy of my diagram" options
  checked. The icons in this diagram are from their "CAE" shapes set.
